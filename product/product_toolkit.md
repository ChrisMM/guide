# Originate Guides - Product Management Best Practices

**It is a Product Manager’s job to determine what to build, it’s an engineer’s job to determine how to build it.**

-----

### PM Toolkit - Epics and Stories

**Epics contextualize and group requests:**
* PMs are problem-solvers of Epics, developers are problem-solvers of stories
* 80% of prioritization should be done at the Epic level
* More than just a collection of stories, Epics should holistically solve a problem YOU identify

-----

### Order of PM Events

Product Managers work to follow a flow such as:

1. Identify Epics
2. Estimate Epics
3. Prioritize Epics
4. Pick Epic(s) for Sprint #1
5. UI Design (optional)
6. Write stories
7. Estimate stories
8. Finalize scope of sprint #1 with stories
9. Development begins
10. Pick Epic(s) for Sprint #2 *

***Rinse and repeat!***

**Doesn’t mean you can’t plan ahead*

### Recommendations

* **It all starts with the Epic.** Epics are full-stack “problem themes” that teams should work 
together to solve, and move on once it’s complete.

* **Focus on the benefits of storywriting and AC**, why it’s important to follow and the results it produces. 
Team can both understand the format and follow through on the development/testing methodologies that 
support the format.

* **Storywriting and Acceptance Criteria should be a core piece of a Product Manager’s job.** 
It’s his/her responsibility to make sure they are accurate, complete, and move the product forward.

* **Story tracking system (JIRA, Pivotal, etc.) must be accepted and used as the source of truth 
organization-wide.** You cannot be an effectively operating (and distributed) team without tracking stories 
and conversations.

* **All stories should be reviewed and accepted by a Product Manager (or equivalent)** alongside
support of QA review.
This has the additional effect of forcing the team to rely on Acceptance Criteria to accept/reject stories.
